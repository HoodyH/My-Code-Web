Discord.py alternatives

Source: https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1

Rapptz after about 6 years of work on discord.py announced that he had stoped the mantainment of the project, development has ceased and the repository has been put into read-only mode.

A lot of bots are based on discord.py library. 
Now after 5 months from the announcement and since the discord migraton to slash commands is behind the corner wich are the best alternatives to the library?

Discord expects all bots to migrate over to Slash Commands by April 2022, so the time has come to take an action.

## Main repo
- https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

## Alternative libs
- https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari

## Forks ordered by stars:
- Nextcord https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord
- Pycord https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord
- Best Lib/Fork?
- Novus https://github.com/Voxel-Fox-Ltd/Novus

Most functionalities will stay still working for a long time, but newer ones will not be implemend.

Topics:
- Is it worth rewriting the code to change lib or stay on a fork?
- Are there some crazy ppl that will reimplement in anoter language?
- What would you do in this situation?

If you guys have any suggestion
